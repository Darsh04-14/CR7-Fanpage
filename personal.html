          elder brother Hugo is the director of ‚ÄúMuseu CR7‚Äù as he is into the

          Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout
          his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and
          tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a
          Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his
          family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to
          raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.In 2012, Ronaldo and
          his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian
          boy with apparently terminal cancer. In December 2012, Ronaldo joined
          FIFA's "11 for Health" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of
          how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV,
          malaria and obesity. In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the
          Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help
          fight child hunger and obesity. Ronaldo was named the world's most
          charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating ¬£5 million to the
          relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000
          people. In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his ‚Ç¨600,000
          Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the Champions League. He
          also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone
          marrow.
