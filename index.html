            Ronaldo first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and
            then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting
            Lisbon), where he played for that clubâ€™s various youth teams before
            making his debut on Sportingâ€™s first team in 2002. A tall player at
            6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the
            pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a
            free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with
            a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in
            opposing defenses. After a successful season with Sporting that
            brought the young player to the attention of Europeâ€™s biggest
            football clubs, Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester
            United in 2003.

            At Manchester United, Ronaldo was an instant sensation and soon came
            to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest
            season with United came in 2007-08, when he scored 42 League and Cup
            goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe's leading scorer,
            with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League
            title in May 2008, Ronaldo captured FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de
            Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours for his
            stellar 2007-08 season. He also led United to an appearance in the
            2009 Champions League final, which they lost to FC Barcelona.

            Soon thereafter Ronaldo was sold to Spain's Real Madridâ€”a club with
            which he had long been rumoured to want to playâ€”for a then record
            Â£80 million (about $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess
            continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La
            Liga history, at the time, during the 2010-11 season. In 2011-12
            Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a
            personal-best 46 goals during the League season. He scored a total
            of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese
            national team in 2013 to earn his Ballon d'Or award. In 2014 he
            scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions League
            title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d'Or
            award. In 2014-15 he netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring.
            Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October 2015 to
            become the club's all-time leading goal scorer. He scored 35 La Liga
            goals in 2015-16 and helped Real win its record 11th Champions
            League title, and in December 2016 he won a fourth career Ballon
            d'Or for his accomplishments. Ronaldo scored 42 goals for Real
            across all competitions in 2016-17 and led his team to La Liga and
            Champions League titles that season, which resulted in a fifth
            career Ballon d'Or award. In 2017-18 he scored 44 goals in 44 games,
            and won a third straight Champions League title.

            In July 2018 he reached a four-year contract worth â‚¬112 million
            (about $132 million) with the Italian powerhouse Juventus. He scored
            28 goals in his first season with Juventusâ€”his lowest domestic goal
            total since his last season with Manchester Unitedâ€”as the powerhouse
            club won its eighth straight Italian league title. Ronaldo improved
            his goal tally in the following season by netting 37 goals in all
            competitions and saw Juventus win the Italian League title for the
            nineth consecutive year. In his third and final season for Juventus,
            Ronaldo scored 36 goals in all competitions and was awarded the
            Italian League top scorer award. Having scored 100 goals in 131
            games for Juventus, Ronaldo became only the fourth fastest player to
            score 100 goals for a single club. Though he still tops the list as
            his 100 goals in 105 games with Real Madrid remains unbeaten.

            In a blockbuster move during August of 2021, Manchester United saw
            the return of a 36 year old Cristiano Ronaldo for a transfer fee of
            â‚¬15 million ($17.7 million). There was much speculation upon the The
            return of Ronaldo as he was not the same player that left Manchester
            United back in 2008. Many pundits and journalists have criticized
            Manchester United for signing Ronaldo and questioned his ability to
            perform at the top level while playing in the toughest league in the
            world. Though, like always, Ronaldo was quick to shut mouths by
            scoring a brace on his debut against Newcastle United. Since then,
            Ronaldo has scored a respectable 13 goals in 18 appearances for the
            Red Devils and has also qualified them for the Round of Sixteen in
            the Champions League.
